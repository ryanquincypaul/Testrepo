## Areas of Improvement

These is a very basic rating system since most of these skills are multi-faceted. While I won't be able to move the number up on computer programming after the course, I probably stand to gain the most in that category as I learn more about R, a language I have no prior experience with. I stand to gain the most in Stats where I have a base knowledge from college 10 years ago and in Machine Learning where I have no prior experience whatsoever.
